# nelder-mead-optimization-method

This project is a demonstration of the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. The algorithm is used to find a local minimum of a given function and an animation is produced that displays the progress of the the optimization method towards approximating the local minimum by drawing out the simple geometric interpritation of the method.

# Usage

This project can easily be run using Jupyter Notebook

# Animation

For a demonstration of the output of this project, see the video file Nelder-Mead.mp4
